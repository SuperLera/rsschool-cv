I love developing modern websites and applications.
At the moment I'm seeking a challenging environment where I can use my skills in web development to reach company's strategic and financial goals and to realize myself as a specialist.
I also always strive to be a good team player as I'm convinced that only teamwork can achieve the best results and create really powerful things.

## Code
Function that finds the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. The integers can be large, so we need a clever solution.
```
function mygcd (x,y) {
  while (x !=0 && y!=0) {
    if (x > y) {
      x = x % y;
    } else {
      y = y % x;
    }
  }
  return (x + y);
}
```
